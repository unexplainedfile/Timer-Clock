# Timer-Clock
A very basic Web page which tells you about remaining time in your upcoming important dates such as a friend's Birthday, so that you can't miss the opportunity of giving him/her a surprise party or gifts. It involves some basic concepts of html, css and it tests the ability of logic building in Javascript.
